        <hr>
        <p>We offer the opportunity to connect with car carriers for shipping opportunities. Specifically, we hope to target situations where your truck is partially empty
          and allow you to fill up that extra space for extra cash.
        <br><br>
          Our website allows you to post the extra empty space in your shipping vehicles and allow car dealerships or other's that need to transport cars to bid on it ensuring
          that you receive the best price. Simply create an account for free on our website and you can start posting immediately!
        <br><br>
          If you don't want to post your empty space, you can instead bid on various shipping opportunities that we have on our website. This will have a two dollar surcharge
          when paying for a successful bid.
