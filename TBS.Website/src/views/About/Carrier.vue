        <hr>
        <p>We offer the opportunity to both bid on shipping opportunities or post your own shipping requests. If you wish to bid on a shippers empty space, please create an account
          (which is completely free) and you can start bidding on posts right away!
        </p>
        <p>If you're on the flip side of this and wish to post your requirements to ship, this is also completely free. You can create your own post with your requirements 
          that shippers can bid on if you're willing to wait for a period of time for the bidding.
